## Install GitLab Runner on Debian

*  Add GitLabâ€™s official repository:

curl -L https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-runner/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```

* Install the latest version of GitLab Runner

```bash
sudo apt-get install gitlab-runner
```

* [Register the Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html)
